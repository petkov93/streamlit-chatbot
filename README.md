# Funny Chat bot with Streamlit

1. Add you own API key into .env file 
   - It doesn't neet to be  from xAI, you can use other API's, just change the url path and endpoint in const.py
   - If its paid API, you can send in the request only the last prompt(prompt + system message) for less token usage
   - Otherwise u can send the whole conversation
2. To run the web app on localhost:
<<<<<<< HEAD
   - In terminal -> ***streamlit run server.py***


3. To run the chatbot in terminal:
   - In terminal -> ***python ai_agent.py*** or ***python3 ai_agent.py***


I use different SYSTEM_MESSAGES to test what the bot is capable of, 
later on I will add an option to let the user choose what personality the bot should use.
